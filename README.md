## About The App/ How to use:

This is a simple app that you can use to make your ToDo lists.. and also to share with others! I made sure to include all the CRUD futures which you can use by adding lists, selecting the lists, updating the lists and deleting the lists. 


## How It's Made:

This app was made with a lot of tools that I have never used before a week before making this app. A lot of research, study and understanding before and during working on this project. This is very normal now and nothing special but I found it super fascinating to learn how you can store your data and share it with others and even be able to change things on the client-side ..!


## Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, express, axios, mongoose, nodemon, 



## Lessons Learned:


It was a very good practice of using nodemon, postman, MongoDB and Axios. I felt more comfortable using Node.js, express and Heroku as well. Connecting the client-side and server-side was confusing and hard to picture in my head how that actually works at first, but by creating this app I was able to learn a lot of backend stuff.
